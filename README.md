# satellite-videocoding
<b> Observation satellites provide high-resolution images that help create high-quality applications. Thus, real-time video coding is a critical task in edge computing on satellites. Unlike consumer electronics, recording videos from a satellite is heavily limited in hardware, energy consumption, and data transmission bandwidth. This paper proposes an edge computing-based video coding implementation on the Earth observation satellite. This paper also shows the hardware architecture design to implement proposed video coding algorithms that can real-time encoding video with limited resources and power. Additionally, the compression ratio between raw video and compressed data is up to 38. The hardware encoding speed reaches up (18.69 ~ 18.95) fps for 2560Ã—2560 video at 125-MHz.  Moreover, the tiny moving objects tracking are detected precisely the same between raw video and decompressed video. Therefore, this paper presents a hardware algorithm and implementation for video coding on satellite using fewer resources and power with high decompression quality that meets remote sensing needs.</b>
